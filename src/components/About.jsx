        <p>I've been a lifelong musician and creative, and Graduated from the Berklee College of Music in 2016. I found a love of music technology in college, and through that venture, I found a love for programming. I took an html class, and after that, a course called Audio Programming in C (aka 'CSound'). I can admit that I didn't excell in the class, (I had no programming experience), but I was in awe with the possiblilities and this new world of programming.</p>
        <p>It took me too long, but I recently graduated from the software engineering bootcamp at the Flatiron School. My time at the school solidified what I already knew. I love programing, and have felt more fufillment from these months than anything else in my life.</p>
        <p>I have experience coding in JavaScript, React, Python, and Python with Flask. I am currently learning Java and C.</p>
        <p>I am very passionate about innovation and writing clean code. I am a very hard worker, and believe in creating solutions with scalability from the ground up. I truly love to code, and I feel I have found my passion with programming.</p>
